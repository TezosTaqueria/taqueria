# Taqueria Flextesa Plugin

This is a plugin developed for Taqueria built using TypeScript for NodeJS using the Taqueria Node SDK.

The plugin provides a `start sandbox` task used for starting a Flextesa-based sandbox, `stop sandbox` to stop the sandbox, and `list accounts` to list the available accounts provided by the sandbox along with their current balances.

This plugin uses a docker image called `taqueria/flextesa`, which is available [here](/docker):
