(*
  These are Unit Tests for the hello-taco Smart Contract. They use the CameLIGO Test
  library. For more information: https://ligolang.org/docs/reference/test?lang=cameligo

  To run these tests, invoke:

     $ taq test hello-tacos.test.mligo --plugin @taqueria/plugin-ligo

  ** Good to Know **

  => There is no deployment to, or interaction with, any Tezos blockchain instance
  => These tests only exercise the logic of the contract: not any integration
  => These tests are fast, but also isolated to the context of the contract

  ** Conventions **

  => `_good` denotes the happy *test* path - i.e. including when failure is expected
  => `_bad` denotes when a test has genuinely failed
  => Many variable names mirror their parameter or type name, Ã  la Python
