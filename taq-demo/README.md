# TAQ-DEMO README

This directory contains a script `taq-demo.sh` which endeavors to showcase Taqueria functionality in a predictable, repeatable and idempotent fashion.

The idea is to focus on core functionality, and for details like copying files and checking versions to fade into the background.

# HOW TO RUN IT

* Source the file with `source ./taq-demo.sh` and run with `demo`

Please read `taq-demo.sh` to learn more.
