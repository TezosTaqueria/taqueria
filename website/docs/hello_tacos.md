title: Hello Tacos
---

We have made a basic Hello ~~World~~ _Tacos_ Tezos dApp. This dApp shows off the structure of a Tezos dApp and all its components.

The Hello Tacos dApp consists of;

- A Taco counting Smart Contract implemented in the following languages
    - Ligo
    - SmartPy
    - Michelson
- A React web application that interacts with the on-chain smart-contract
- Intergration tests that verify the expected behaviour of the smart-contract when on-chain
