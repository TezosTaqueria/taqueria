title: Taqueria Workflows
---


1. Smart contract development workflow (compose, compile, originate, test, repeat)
2. Full stack dev workflow (compose smart contract, compile, generate types, compose app using types, config, and state; originate & deploy app; test app; repeat)
3. Scaffolding a project (scaffold, start)
4. Deployment orchestration


Levels of Complexity:

1. Beginner - Scaffolding
2. Basic - Using Taqueria as a task runner (Tasks and plugins)
3. Intermediate - Using config/state/types in full stack development
4. Advanced - using Taqueria for full stack dev and orchestration - GitHub action, provisions
