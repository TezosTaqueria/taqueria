title: Networks
---

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a streamlined manner. Networks are configured in the Taqueria `config.json` file and added to an environment which allows you to target that network when running commands such as `taq originate`

Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release

:::note
This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or deploying to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](../plugins/flextesa/flextesa.md)
