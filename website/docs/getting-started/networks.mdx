This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or deploying to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](../docs/plugins/plugin-flextesa.md/))
:::

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets (including faucet keys) which can then be targeted by Taqueria through the use of Taqueria Environments

To work with Taqueria Networks, there are three basic steps:
1. Networks are configured and named in the Taqueria `config.json` file where you can add a faucet key
2. Named networks are added to an environment in `config.json`, which is then used to target a specific network
3. The network can then be targeted by Taqueria by passing the environment name to the CLI command `taq originate --env ithicaNet`


## Requirements

:::note
Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release
:::

To configure and use a Taqueria network, you will require the following:
1. Configuration details for the network you wish to target (Can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
2. A faucet key for the network you wish to target (Also found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
3. The [Taquito plugin](../plugins/plugin-taquito.md/) (Used for originating to a network)

### Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all prootocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here]https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+) 


## Configuration

:::note
The network configuration for various protocols, as well as the faucet for each can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/).
:::

To configure a network for use, you will need to configure the network, and then add that network to an environment. To illustrate the configuration of a network, we will use the [Ithica testnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ithica-testnet/) as an example in this document and will configure a network named `ithica`, and an environment named `ithicanet`

Taqueria does not have a default network configured, so a freshly initialized project will have a `config.json` file that looks like this:
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "accounts": {
                "default": "bob",
                "bob": {
                    "initialBalance": "3000000000"
                },
                "alice": {
                    "initialBalance": "2000000000"
                },
                "john": {
                    "initialBalance": "4000000000"
                },
                "jane": {
                    "initialBalance": "5000000000"
                },
                "joe": {
                    "initialBalance": "1000000000"
                }
            },
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtHangz2aRngywmSRGGvrcTyMbbdpWdpFKuS4uMWxg2RaH9i1qx",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {}
}
```

### Network Configuration

The first step is to add a named network configuration to your `config.json` file

Add the following entry ("ithicanet": {...}) to the `network` property::
```json
{
   "network":{
      "ithicanet":{
         "label":"Ithica Protocol Testnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ithacanet.teztnets.xyz",
         "protocol":"Psithaca2MLRFYargivpo7YvUr7wUDqyxrdhC5CQq78mRvimz6A",
         "faucet":{  }
      }
   }
```
:::note
The information for `rpcUrl` and`protocol` are taken from the [https://teztnets.xyz/ithacanet-about](https://teztnets.xyz/ithacanet-about) page
:::

### Faucets 

In order to interact with the network, you will need some Tez in an account. The way this is done on Tezos is to provide a faucet key. The faucet key provides Tez on a particular testnet, which can then be used to interact with the network

To get your own unique faucet key for testing, visit [https://teztnets.xyz/ithacanet-faucet](https://teztnets.xyz/ithacanet-faucet), and complete the captcha validation. Once this is done, you will see the faucet key shown as a JSON object

To add the faucet key to your Taqueria project, simply copy and paste the JSON object into the `faucet` field of the network configuration shown above

Your `network` property should now look something like this:
```json
{
   "network":{
      "ithica":{
         "label":"Ithica Protocol Testnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ithacanet.teztnets.xyz",
         "protocol":"Psithaca2MLRFYargivpo7YvUr7wUDqyxrdhC5CQq78mRvimz6A",
         "faucet":{
            "key": {
	            "pkh": "tz1cEqJmGnzcGDa9cyj437RmLL5GYPiawiUc",
                "mnemonic": [
                    "other",
                    "nerve",
                    "awkward",
                    "jaguar",
                    "anchor",
                    "conduct",
                    "drill",
                    "upon",
                    "roof",
                    "planet",
                    "glass",
                    "among",
                    "turkey",
                    "also",
                    "urban"
                ],
                "email": "kgwzskbc.tootktlz@teztnets.xyz",
                "password": "JTMMX6FPNM",
                "amount": "2006437205",
                "activation_code": "50fe648444288c8dd1fe1e976ca26160536fda94"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### Environment Configuration

:::note
For additional information regarding Taqueria Environments, please see the documentation [here](environments.mdx/)
:::

The final step in configuration is to add the network to an environment. In this example, we will create a new environment named `ithicanet` which will contain the `ithica` network

To do this, find the `environment` property in your `config.json` file. By default it will look something like this:
```json
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
    },
```

Add a new environment named `ithicanet`, and add the named network `ithica` to it's `networks` array.
```json
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
        "ithicanet": {
            "networks": [
                "ithica"
            ],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
```

### Finished Configuration

At this point, you should have a fully configured network named `ithica` which is configured to target the Ithica testnet using a faucet, and an environment named `ithicanet` which can be used to target the network from the CLI

Your `config.json` file should look something like this: 
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
        "ithicanet": {
            "networks": [
                "ithica"
            ],
            "sandboxes": [],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "accounts": {
                "default": "bob",
                "bob": {
                    "initialBalance": "3000000000"
                },
                "alice": {
                    "initialBalance": "2000000000"
                },
                "john": {
                    "initialBalance": "4000000000"
                },
                "jane": {
                    "initialBalance": "5000000000"
                },
                "joe": {
                    "initialBalance": "1000000000"
                }
            },
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtHangz2aRngywmSRGGvrcTyMbbdpWdpFKuS4uMWxg2RaH9i1qx",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {
        "ithica":{
            "label":"Ithica Protocol Testnet",
            "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ithacanet.teztnets.xyz",

               }
            }
         }
      }
    }
}
```

## Targeting a Network

Taqueria uses Environments to target a specific network or sandbox. An environment is a named collection of network configurations which can be passed to the CLI using the `--env` flag

To target the `ithica` network we configured above using the `ithicanet` environment, simply run the following command:
```shell
taq originate --env ithicanet
```
