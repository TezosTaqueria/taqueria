This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or deploying to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](../plugins/flextesa/flextesa.md)

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets (including faucet keys) which can then be targeted by Taqueria through the use of Taqueria Environments

To work with Taqueria Networks, there are three basic steps:
1. Networks are configured and named in the Taqueria `config.json` file where you can add a faucet key
2. Named networks are added to an environment in `config.json`, which is then used to target a specific network
3. The network can then be targeted by Taqueria by passing the environment name to the CLI command `taq originate --env ithicaNet`


## Requirements

:::note
Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release
:::

To configure and use a Taqueria network, you will require the following:
1. Configuration details for the network you wish to target (Can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
2. A faucet key for the network you wish to target (Also found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
3. The [Taquito plugin](../plugins/taquito/taquito.md) (Used for originating to a network)

### Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all prootocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here]https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+) 


## Configuration

:::note
The network configuration for various protocols, as well as the faucet for each can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/).
:::

To configure a network for use, you will need to configure the network, and then add that network to an environment. To illustrate the configuration of a network, we will use the [Ithica testnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ithica-testnet/) as an example in this document

Taqueria does not have a default network configured, so a freshly initialized project will have a `config.json` file that looks like this:
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "accounts": {
                "default": "bob",
                "bob": {
                    "initialBalance": "3000000000"
                },
                "alice": {
                    "initialBalance": "2000000000"
                },
                "john": {
                    "initialBalance": "4000000000"
                },
                "jane": {
                    "initialBalance": "5000000000"
                },
                "joe": {
                    "initialBalance": "1000000000"
                }
            },
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtHangz2aRngywmSRGGvrcTyMbbdpWdpFKuS4uMWxg2RaH9i1qx",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {}
}
```

### Network Configuration

The first step is to add a named network configuration to your `config.json` file

The basic structure of the network configuration is as follows:
```json
{
   "network":{
      "hangzhounet":{
         "label":"ithicaTestnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://invalid.test",
         "protocol":"PtHangz2aRngywmSRGGvrcTyMbbdpWdpFKuS4uMWxg2RaH9i1qx",
         "faucet":{  }
      }
   }
```

### Environment Configuration

## Targeting a Network

Taqueria uses Environments to target a specific network. An environment is a named collection of network configurations which can be passed to the CLI using the `--env` flag
