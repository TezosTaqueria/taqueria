:::note
This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or deploying to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](../plugins/flextesa/flextesa.md)

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets (including faucet keys) which can then be targeted by Taqueria through the use of Taqueria Environments

To work with Taqueria Networks, there are three basic steps:
1. Networks are configured and named in the Taqueria `config.json` file where you can add a faucet key
2. Named networks are added to an environment in `config.json`, which is then used to target a specific network
3. The network can then be targeted by Taqueria by passing the environment name to the CLI command `taq originate --env ithicaNet`


## Requirements

:::note
Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release
:::

To configure and use a Taqueria network, you will require the following:
1. Configuration details for the network you wish to target (Can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
2. A faucet key for the network you wish to target (Also found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
3. The [Taquito plugin](../plugins/taquito/taquito.md) (Used for originating to a network)

### Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all prootocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here]https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+)
