<!-- 
Content Type: Getting Started Documentation

Purpose: To get a developer set up and ready to go with Taqueria in under 5 minutes

Goal: To onboard as many devs as possible by translating their interest into them actually developing on Taqueria

Questions:
- What is the quickest explanation of Taqueria and what it does?
- What are the most important questions new users will have?
- What are the cool things you can do with Taqueria? 
-->

## Overview

This quickstart guide will teach you the fundamentals of using Taqueria in 10 minutes by going through the process of running some basic tasks in Taqueria from the CLI

What you will accomplish:
- Initialize a new Taqueria project
- Install plugins for LIGO, Flextesa, and Taquito
- Creating a new LIGO contract, along with its associated storages and parameters files.
- Compile the LIGO smart contract
- Start a local Flextesa sandbox 
- Originate the compiled smart contract to the sandbox

## Requirements

To successfully follow this guide, you must ensure that:
- The Taqueria CLI has been [installed](./installation.mdx) and is available in your `$PATH` 
- Docker 0.8 (or later) is installed and currently running
- Node.js v16.3 (or later) is installed

:::note
The Taqueria VS Code Extension provides direct access to Taqueria tasks from the command palette. Under the hood, the VS Code Extension makes calls to the CLI, so you can be assured the behaviour of tasks will remain consistent regardless of whether they are executed from a terminal or the command palette. The steps in this guide are for using the Taqueria CLI, but you can also run the commands from the Taqueria extension via the VS Code command palette if you prefer

## Starting a Taqueria Project

There are two things required to start using Taqueria on a project

First, the project must have been initialized by Taqueria. This process creates a hidden directory `./.taq` inside the project directory that contains the configuration and state files required by Taqueria, and ensures the required directories `/contracts` and `/artifacts` have been created 

Taqueria provides the command `init` which will create a new directory with the correct structure and configuration. To create a new Taqueria project called `my-first-project`, run the command:
```shell
taq init my-first-project
```
:::caution
If a project has already been initialized, Taqueria will not re-initialize the project, but will still return a success message. This will be fixed in an upcoming release
:::

After the project has been initialized you are ready to start working with Taqueria. Navigate to your project directory and we will explore working with plugins:
```shell
cd my-first-project
```

## Working with Plugins

Now that the project has been properly initialized, plugins can be installed to provide support for specific functionality such as compilation, smart contract origination, or running sandbox environments

Plugins are installed using the `taq install` command which appears in the command list once a project is initialized. You can view the list of commands available in the current project context by running `taq --help` from the CLI:
```shell
❯ taq --help
taq <command>

Commands:
  taq init [projectDir]           Initialize a new project
  taq opt-in                      Opt-in to sharing anonymous usage analytics
  taq opt-out                     Opt-out of sharing anonymous usage analytics
  taq install <pluginName>        Install a plugin
  taq uninstall <pluginName>      Uninstall a plugin
  taq add-contract <sourceFile>   Add a contract to the contract registry
  taq rm-contract <contractName>  Remove a contract from the contract registry
  taq list-contracts              List registered contracts
```

Once a plugin has been installed, you will see the additional commands provided by the plugin added to the list

## Working with LIGO Smart Contracts

To add support for the LIGO smart contract language, install the LIGO plugin by running:
```shell
taq install @taqueria/plugin-ligo
```

Copy the following 3 code snippets, with the names suggested at the top, to the `/contracts` folder of your Taqueria project.

```ligo title="counter.mligo"
type storage = int

type parameter =
  Increment of int
| Decrement of int
| Reset

type return = operation list * storage

// Two entrypoints

let add (store, delta : storage * int) : storage = store + delta
let sub (store, delta : storage * int) : storage = store - delta

(* Main access point that dispatches to the entrypoints according to
   the smart contract parameter. *)

let main (action, store : parameter * storage) : return =
 ([] : operation list),    // No operations
 (match action with
   Increment (n) -> add (store, n)
 | Decrement (n) -> sub (store, n)
 | Reset         -> 0)
```

```ligo title="counter.storages.mligo"
let initial_count: storage = 42
let another_count: storage = 23 + 18 - 1
```

```ligo title="counter.parameters.mligo"
let increment_by_3: parameter = Increment 3
```

You can now compile this contract, along with its storage and parameter values, by simply running the following command from the root of the project directory:
```shell
taq compile counter.mligo
```

Taqueria will then output the following, and the artifacts created:
```shell
❯ taq compile counter.mligo                     
┌──────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Contract                 │ Artifact                                      │
├──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ counter.mligo            │ artifacts/counter.tz                          │
├──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ counter.storages.mligo   │ artifacts/counter.default_storage.tz          │
│                          │ artifacts/counter.storage.another_count.tz    │
├──────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ counter.parameters.mligo │ artifacts/counter.parameter.increment_by_3.tz │
└──────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If you open this file (`/artifacts/counter.tz`), you can view the raw Michelson code which will later be originated to the sandbox:
```
{ parameter (or (or (int %decrement) (int %increment)) (unit %reset)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { UNPAIR ;
         IF_LEFT { IF_LEFT { SWAP ; SUB } { ADD } } { DROP 2 ; PUSH int 0 } ;
         NIL operation ;
         PAIR } }
```


### Starting a Flextesa Sandbox

The next step is to install the Flextesa plugin which provides a local Tezos sandbox network:
```shell
taq install @taqueria/plugin-flextesa
```

Once installed, the plugin provides three commands to start, stop, and query a sandbox:
- `taq start sandbox [sandboxName]`
- `taq stop sandbox [sandboxName]`
- `taq list accounts [sandboxName]`

:::note
Sandboxes are configured in the project's Taqueria configuration file (`./.taq/config.json`). Each named sandbox configuration can then be called from the CLI.
By default, every Taqueria project comes pre-configured with a sandbox named `local`
:::

Start up the sandbox named `local` by running:
```shell
taq start sandbox local
```

To confirm the sandbox is running, query the sandbox for the account information:
```shell
taq list accounts local
```

If successful, you will see a list of the accounts and balances specified in the `config.json` file that have been created on the Tezos blockchain in the sandbox:
```
❯ taq list accounts local
┌─────────┬─────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Account │ Balance │ Address                              │
├─────────┼─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ bob     │ 3000 ꜩ  │ tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6 │
├─────────┼─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────┴─────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Originating a Contract with Taquito

With a sandbox now running, the next step is to originate the `counter.tz` file to the sandbox network using the Taquito plugin

First, install the plugin:
```shell
taq install @taqueria/plugin-taquito
```

Now you can originate the contract by running:
```shell
taq originate counter.tz
```

This will originate `counter.tz` in the `/artifacts` directory to the sandbox and return the on-chain address of the originated contract. This will look something like this:
```
┌────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┬─────────┬─────────────┐
│ Contract   │ Address                              │ Alias   │ Destination │
├────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┼─────────┼─────────────┤
│ counter.tz │ KT1Ayz8qos7G4U3Jucp6QWoM7ayhbShNXcat │ counter │ local       │
└────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────────┘
```
