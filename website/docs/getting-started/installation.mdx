## Taqueria Installation Basics

Installing Taqueria is a quick and easy process if you understand a few basic concepts and follow the steps outlined in this guide

There are two main components to install:

- The Taqueria CLI, an executable binary named `taq` installed globally in your shell's `$PATH`
- A VS Code plugin installed directly through the VS Code Extension Marketplace

## Requirements

### Taqueria CLI

- A compatable operating system:
  - MacOS
  - Linux
  - Windows (via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 


### VS Code Extension

The VS Code Extension requires a recent version of Microsoft Visual Studio Code which can be installed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installing the Taqueria CLI

### Overview

Installing the Taqueria CLI involves the following steps:

1. Download the correct build of Taqueria for your operating system
2. Make the Taqueria binary `taq` executable
3. Add `taq` to your shell's `$PATH`

Once these steps are complete, you will be able to run Taqueria from your terminal using the `taq` command


### OS Specific Instructions

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

1. Download the latest MacOS build of Taqueria

```shell
curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/macos/taq
```

2. Make the binary file executable

```shell
chmod +x taq
```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your shell's `$PATH`

```shell
sudo mv taq /usr/local/bin
````

4. Disable MacOS Gatekeeper to allow Taqueria to run

```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

:::caution
Currently the `taq` binary is not signed for Mac OS. In order to run Taqueria, users must disable MacOS Gatekeeper (*This is not ideal*)  
This is a temporary workaround until we can sign the binaries (see [#129](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/129))

If you want to re-enable the MacOS Gatekeeper later on, run the command  
`sudo spctl --master-enable`
