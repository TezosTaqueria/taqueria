## Taqueria Installation Basics

Installing Taqueria is a quick and easy process if you understand a few basic concepts and follow the steps outlined in this guide

There are two main components you can install:

- The Taqueria CLI (required)
- The VS Code plugin for Taqueria (optional)

:::note
The Taqueria CLI is required to use the VS Code extension and as such, must be installed first
:::

## Requirements

### Taqueria CLI

- Node.js v16.3 or later
- A compatable operating system:
  - MacOS
  - Linux
  - Windows (via [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) v0.8 or later


## Installing the Taqueria CLI

### Overview

The Taqueria CLI is an executable binary named `taq`, installed globally in your shell's `$PATH`

Installing the Taqueria CLI involves the following steps:

1. Download the correct build of Taqueria for your operating system
2. Make the Taqueria binary `taq` executable
3. Add `taq` to your shell's `$PATH`

Once these steps are complete, you will be able to run Taqueria from your terminal using the `taq` command

### OS Specific Instructions

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

1. Download the latest MacOS build of Taqueria

```shell
curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/macos/taq
```

2. Make the binary file executable

```shell
chmod +x taq
```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your shell's `$PATH`

```shell
sudo mv taq /usr/local/bin
````

4. Disable MacOS Gatekeeper to allow Taqueria to run

```shell
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

:::caution
Currently the `taq` binary is not signed for Mac OS. In order to run Taqueria, users must disable MacOS Gatekeeper (*This is not ideal*)  
This is a temporary workaround until we can sign the binaries (see [#129](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/129))

If you want to re-enable the MacOS Gatekeeper later on, run the command  
`sudo spctl --master-enable`

<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

Windows users will run the Linux version of Taqueria in Ubuntu using the Windows Subsystem for Linux ([WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))

#### Requirements

You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher, or Windows 11

#### Install WSL 2

1. Open a Power Shell or Windows Command Prompt as an adminstrator and run:
  
  ```shell
  wsl --install
  ```

2. Restart your machine

3. Open the Ubuntu distribution using the Start if it doesn't start automatically after restarting

4. Create a user name and password

#### Install Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend

1. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)

2. Run the installer making sure to enable WSL 2 during the installation if prompted

3. Start Docker Desktop from the Windows Start menu

4. From the Docker menu, navigate to `Settings > General` and select `Use WSL 2 based engine` if not already selected

5. Click `Apply & Restart`

To confirm that Docker Desktop backend has been installed properly, open a WSL 2 terminal and run:
```shell
wsl.exe -l -v
```

You should see the following output:

```
NAME                   STATE           VERSION 
* Ubuntu               Running         2 
docker-desktop-data    Running         2 
docker-desktop         Running         2
```

#### Install Node v16

1. Update the `apt` package index:

```shell
sudo apt update
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install curl git
```

3. Download Node.js v16.x

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```

4. Install Node.js

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

5. (Optional) Install the node development tools

```shell
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make
```

To confirm that Node v16.x has been installed properly, open a new WSL 2 terminal and run:

```shell
node --version
```

You should see `v16.16.0` or similar returned

#### Install the Taqueria Binary

1. Download the latest Linux build of Taqueria

```shell
curl -LO https://taqueria.io/get/linux/taq
```

2. Make the binary file executable

```shell
chmod +x taq
```

3. Move the binary to a directory in your shell's `$PATH`

```shell
sudo mv taq /usr/local/bin
```
