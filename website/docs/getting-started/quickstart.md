## Overview

This quickstart guide is a high-level, hands-on guide that will teach you the fundamentals of using Taqueria in 10 minutes by going through the process of running some basic tasks in Taqueria from the CLI

What you will accomplish:
- Initialize a new Taqueria project
- Install plugins for LIGO, Flextesa, and Taquito
- Compile a LIGO smart contract to Michelson
- Start a local Flextesa sandbox 
- Originate the smart contract to the Flextesa sandbox

## Requirements

To successfully follow this guide, you must ensure that:
- The Taqueria CLI has been [installed](./installation.mdx) and is available in your `$PATH` 
- Docker is installed and currently running

:::note
The Taqueria VS Code Extension provides direct access to Taqueria tasks from the command palette. Under the hood, the VS Code Extension makes calls to the CLI, so you can be assured the behaviour of tasks will remain consistent regardless of wether they are executed from a terminal or the command palette. The steps in this guide are for using the Taqueria CLI, but you can also run the commands from the Taqueria extension via the VS Code command palette if you prefer
