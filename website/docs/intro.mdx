audience: crypto literate readers and developers looking to USE Taqueria (rather than build on it)

goal: to get the main concepts accross to the in 3 mins or less without losing non-technical folk
purpose: help the user understand what Taqueria is, what it does, and how to proceed

- what are the things a totally green user needs to know to understand Taqueria?
- what can Taqueria do for the user?
- what are the high level concepts you need to know about how to install and use taqueria?

:::note
This is a quick introduction to the main concepts of Taqueria. If you are looking to get started with Taqueria right away with a hands on approach, you can jump to the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) 
:::

Taqueria is here to help make developing on Tezos easier. Taqueria supercharges your projects with a powerful and centralized configuration and access to top Tezos development tools through tasks that you run from the command line

Some of the things Taqueria can do for you include:
- Compiling smart contracts using the [LIGO](/docs/plugins/plugin-ligo/), [SmartPY](/docs/plugins/plugin-smartpy/), or [Archetype](/docs/plugins/plugin-archetype/) plugins
- Running a local sandbox with the [Flextesa](/docs/plugins/plugin-flextesa/) plugin
- Originating a smart contract to a sandbox and testnet with the [Taquito plugin](/docs/plugins/plugin-taquito/)
- Generating TypeScript types from a Michelson contract with the [Contract Types](/docs/plugins/plugin-contract-types/) plugin
- Typechecking Michelson contracts and simulating contract calls with the [Tezos Client](/docs/plugins/plugin-tezos-client/) plugin
- Testing dapps and smart contracts with the [Jest](/docs/plugins/plugin-jest/) plugin
- Publishing metadata and media files to IPFS with the [IPFS Pinata](/docs/plugins/plugin-ipfs-pinata/) plugin

## What is Taqueria?

Taqueria is an extensible, open source plugin based framework and task runner for Tezos development

In more practical terms, Taqueria is a task runner that you can use from the command line or the VS Code command palette to quickly accomplish things like starting a sandbox or originating a contract. Taqueria comes with a few basic tasks, but relies on plugins to add tasks that provide complex and domain specific functionality

Taqueria has a few major components:
 - A command line interface (CLI) you use in your terminal through a command named `taq`
 - A library of plugins that add tasks to Taqueria to do cool and useful things like compiling and originating smart contracts, and type generation
 - A VS Code Extension which provides the ability to run Taqueria tasks from the command palette
 - A GitHub action so Taqueria can be used in your CI/CD workflows

## Basic Components

### Taqueria CLI

The CLI is the main user interface for Taqueria which provides a command `taq` through which you can initialize a project, install/uninstall plugins, and run tasks

Basic usage of the Taqueria CLI involves running a command following the pattern 
```shell
taq [taskName] [options]
```

:::note
Taqueria uses the following conventions for displaying command structure:
- Square brackets `[value]` are  used to indicate optional arguments
- Angle brackets `<value>` are used to indicate required arguments
:::

You can see what tasks are available to run in any given context by running `taq` from the command line

### Taqueria Project

A Taqueria project is one that has been initialized by Taqueria using the `taq init` command. It will have the following directory structure created:
- `/artifacts`: This is where Taqueria will store artifacts that it creates during the course of its execution
- `/contracts`: This is where Taqueria will store smart contracts that it compiles
- `./.taq`: This is where Taqueria will store its configuration

:::note
Configuration for Taqueria projects including accounts, networks, and sandboxes is done in `./.taq/config.json`
:::

### Taqueria Plugins

Taqueria plugins add functionality to Taqueria by adding tasks to Taqueria. Plugins are managed right in Taqueria using the `taq install [pluginName]` and `taq uninstall [pluginName]` commands

Taqueria plugins are installed on a ***per-project*** basis which allows you to customize the combination of technologies used and tasks avalable on a project. This means that the tasks available to run in each project will differ based on the plugins installed

Currently available plugins include:
- LIGO Compiler
- SmartPy Compiler
- Archetype Compiler
- Flextesa Sandbox
- Taquito 
- Contract Types Generator
- Tezos Client
- Jest Test Runner
- IPFS Pinata

### Taqueria SDK

Taqueria has a Node.js SDK which is used by plugins to interact with the Taqueria protocol

:::note
Most developers won't ever interact with the SDK directly unless they are developing a plugin
