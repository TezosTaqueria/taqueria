title: Hello Tacos Scaffold
---

## Introduction

This scaffold is a simple Hello ~~World~~ *_Tacos_* Tezos dApp. It has a simple React app that interacts with a LIGO smart contract which can be deployed on a local sandbox, or testnet

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/hello-tacos-screenshot.png')} />


The project is pre-configured with the following:
- Taqueria v0.3.0 and the LIGO, Flextesa, and Taquito plugins
- A LIGO smart contract `hello-tacos.mligo`  
- A basic React dApp that connects to your wallet with Beacon and interacts with the contract on the testnet

***Coming soon***
- Native Taqueria testing
- Passing the deployed contract address to the React app via the State API
- Deploying and testing on a local sandbox

:::note
Currently, the contract address is hardcoded into the React app and must be updated manually in `/app/index.tsx`

This will be fixed in the future when it will be passed via the State API dynamically 
:::


## Project Overview

The projct is structured as follows:
- `/.taq` - This hidden folder stores the project configuration and State
- `/app` - This is the React app
- `/contracts` - This folder contains the LIGO smart contracts
- `/tests` - This folder contains the tests
- `/artifacts` - This folder contains the compiled Michelson `.tz` contracts

The smart contract `hello-tacos.mligo` stores the number of available tacos, and provides a method to buy tacos which will decrease the number of tacos available if valid as you can see here:

```js
type available_tacos = nat
type tacos_to_buy = nat

let main (tacos_to_buy, available_tacos: tacos_to_buy * available_tacos): operation list * available_tacos =
    if tacos_to_buy > available_tacos
    then (failwith "NOT_ENOUGH_TACOS": operation list * available_tacos)
    else ([]: operation list), abs(available_tacos - tacos_to_buy)
```


## Requirements

- Node.js v16.x (or later)
- Docker v 0.8.0 (or later)
- Taqueria v0.3.1 (or later)
- Temple Wallet (latest version)



## Scaffold the Project

This project is available as a Taqueria scaffold. To create a new project from this scaffold, run the following command:

```shell

taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-hello-tacos-tutorial hello-tacos

```

This will clone the Hello Tacos scaffold project into the `hello-tacos` directory

## Project Setup

There are two steps to setting up the project:

1. Initialize the project with Taqueria:
```shell
taq init
```



## Project Workflow

### Compile the Contract

### Start the local Sandbox

- **** Coming soon with the State API *****

### Originate to the Sandbox

- **** Coming soon with the State API *****
