## Quickstart

In a rush? You can follow the steps below to get up and running immediately:

### Scaffold and Initialize the Project

1. `taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-taco-shop taco-shop`
1. `cd taco-shop`
1. `npm run setup`
1. `npm run start:app`

## Overview

This scaffold implements a simple full stack Tezos project. It has a React dApp that interacts with a smart contract using Taquito. The contract stores the number of `available_tacos` and provides a function to buy tacos

The React dApp uses Beacon Wallet to interact with Tezos wallets in the browser and once connected, will display the number of `available_tacos` stored on-chain in the smart contract. There is also a basic interface which allows the user to buy tacos by sending a transaction to the smart contract with the `number_of_tacos_to_buy` as a parameter

The smart contract has been deployed to ghostnet at the address for demonstration purposes: `KT1KBBk3PXkKmGZn3K6FkktqyPRpEbzJoEPE`

The project comes pre-configured with the following:

- Plugins: LIGO, Flextesa, Taquito, Jest
- A LIGO multi-file smart contract: `hello-tacos.mligo`, `_buy.mligo`, `_make.mligo`, `_schema.mligo`
- A network configuration for the Ghostnet testnet
- An environment named `ghostnet` with faucet to fund operations on the testnet
- Native Taqueria testing (Taqueria Jest plugin)

***Coming soon***

- Passing the deployed contract address to the React dApp via the State API
- Deploying the contract using Taqueria operations
- Targeting a specific network for contract deployment and testing (sandboxes and testnets)
- Deploying the contract to mainnet

## Requirements

- Taqueria v0.24.1 or later
- Docker v20.10.12 or later
- Node.js v16.17.1 or later
- Temple Wallet (can be found [here](https://templewallet.com/))
- A funded testnet account (instructions [here](https://taqueria.io/docs/config/networks/#faucets))


## Using the Project

The intended workflow for this project is as follows:

1. Compile the LIGO multi-file source code
2. Originate the smart contract to the testnet
3. Insert the returned contract address into the React dApp
4. Build and start the React dApp
5. Connect to Temple wallet
6. Buy tacos!

## Project Overview

### Scaffold the Project

This project is available as a Taqueria scaffold. To create a new project from this scaffold, run the following command:

```shell
taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-taco-shop taco-shop
```

This will clone the Taco Shop scaffold project into a directory called `taco-shop`

### Project Setup

To work on the project you need to get into the project directory:

```shell
cd taco-shop
```

### Project Structure

- `.taq` - This hidden folder stores the Taqueria configuration and state
- `app` - This is the React dApp 
- `contracts` - This folder contains the multiple file LIGO smart contract
- `tests` - This folder contains the automated tests
- `artifacts` - This folder contains the compiled Michelson `.tz` contracts

### Smart Contract

The smart contract `hello-tacos.mligo` is simple and straightforward. It stores the number of `available_tacos` in the contract storage, and provides an entrypoint that accepts a `tacos_to_buy` parameter which will decrease the number of available_tacos by the number of tacos_to_buy

1. `hello-tacos.mligo` file itself:
```js
#include "_buy.mligo"
#include "_make.mligo"

let main ((action, store) : (parameter * storage)) =
    match action with
    | Buy qty -> buy(qty, store)
    | Make qty -> make(qty, store)
```

2. `_buy.mligo`
```js
#include "_schema.mligo"

let buy ((tacos_to_buy, store) : (taco_quantity * storage)) =
    if tacos_to_buy > store.available_tacos
    then (failwith "NOT_ENOUGH_TACOS": operation list * storage)
    else (([], {store with available_tacos = abs(store.available_tacos - tacos_to_buy)}) :
        operation list * storage)
```

3. `_make.mligo`
```js
#include "_schema.mligo"

let make ((tacos_to_make, store) : (taco_quantity * storage)) =
    if not (Tezos.get_sender () = store.admin)
    then (failwith "NOT_ALLOWED": operation list * storage)
    else (([], {store with available_tacos = store.available_tacos + tacos_to_make}) : 
        (operation list * storage))
```

4. `_schema.mligo`
```js
type taco_quantity = nat
type admin = address

type storage = {
    available_tacos: taco_quantity;
    admin: admin
}

type parameter =
| Buy of taco_quantity
| Make of taco_quantity
```

5. `hello-tacos.storageList.mligo`
```js
#include "hello-tacos.mligo"
// All storage values must be in this file

// Define a storage variable
let storage: storage = {
    available_tacos = 42n;
    admin = ("tz1ge3zb6kC5iUZcXsjxiwwtU5MwP37T6m1z" : address)
}
```

### Compile the Contract

```shell
taq compile hello-tacos.mligo
```

This will compile multi-file contract `hello-tacos.mligo` to a file, `artifacts/hello-tacos.tz`

### Originate to the Testnet

Run the following command to originate the contract to the ghostnet environment:

```shell
taq originate hello-tacos.tz -e testing
```

This should return the address of the contract on the testnet which looks like this:

```shell
┌────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────┐────────────────┐
│ Contract       │ Address                              │ Alias          │ Destination    │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────┤────────────────┤
│ hello-tacos.tz │ KT1KBBk3PXkKmGZn3K6FkktqyPRpEbzJoEPE │ hello-tacos    │ ghostnet       │
└────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────┘────────────────┘
```

:::caution
This scaffold comes with pre-configured faucet information for the testnet which is shared by all users and can cause issues. It is recommended that you replace the faucet info in the project's `config.json` file with your own whose setup instructions can be found [here](/docs/config/networks/#faucets). You can also get Tez for ghostnet from the [Teztnets Faucet](https://teztnets.xyz/).
:::

### React Dapp

The React dApp retrieves the number of available tacos from the smart contract and displays the value. It provides an interface for the user to buy tacos and looks like this:

![Hello Tacos Screenshot](/img/hello-tacos-screenshot.png)

:::note
In order for the React dApp to connect to the smart contract, the contract must be deployed to the testnet and the returned address of the contract must be added to the `/app/index.tsx` file. The scaffold comes pre-configured with the address of the deployed contract for demonstration purposes but it is recommended that you add your own faucet file, then re-deploy the contract and update the references to it in the project for your own use

This will be fixed in the future when contract addresses will be passed via the State API dynamically
:::

### Insert the Contract Address

There is a way to point the dApp to a hardcoded contract.
To do so you need to insert the address of the contract into the `/app/src/App.tsx` file. Copy the address returned from the command above and paste it into the `contractAddress` variable in the `/app/src/App.tsx` file as shown here, replacing `getAliasAddress(config, "hello-tacos")` with the contract address:

```ts /app/src/App.tsx
function App() {

  // Retrieve the most recent address of the deployed contract

  const [rpcUrl] = useState("https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com");
  const [contractAddress] = useState(
    "KT1KBBk3PXkKmGZn3K6FkktqyPRpEbzJoEPE"
  );
  const [contractStorage, setContractStorage] = useState<Storage | undefined>(
    undefined
  );
  const [Tezos] = useState<TezosToolkit>(new TezosToolkit(rpcUrl));
  const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
```

### Build and Start the React Dapp

Now that the contract has been deployed and the address added to the dApp, you can build and start the React dApp

Change into the `/app` directory:

```shell
cd app
```

Build the React dApp:

```shell
npm run build
```

Start and serve the dApp:

```shell 
npm run start
```

You should now be able to access the Taco Shop dApp at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Hot Reload Contract Address 

By default, page refresh updates the page UI to point to the address of the new deployment.

### Connect to Temple Wallet

Open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

You should see the number of `available_tacos` displayed

Click on the `Connect wallet` button in the top right corner of the page and select `Temple Wallet`

Provide your credentials for the wallet, select a funded account, and click `connect`

### Buy Tacos using the dApp

With your wallet connected, you can now interact with the contract entrypoint

Click the `order` button and then authorize the transaction in Temple Wallet

Once completed, you will see the value of `available_tacos` decrease by the number of tacos you ordered

## Testing

This scaffold comes with Jest tests in the `tests` folder which has been initalized as a partition. The scaffold uses the `@taqueria/plugin-jest` plugin to run the tests

To run the tests, first make sure you have started a local sandbox by running:

```shell
taq start sandbox local
```

Then, run the Jest tests in the `tests` directory with the following command:

```shell
taq test
```
