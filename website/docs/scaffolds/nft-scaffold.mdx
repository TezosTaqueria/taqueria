:::warning
The NFT-Scaffold project is currently in alpha. It is not ready for production use and will be undergoing frequent updates as we work to implement Taqueria State and other features that have not yet been released
:::

## Project Setup 

1. Scaffold the project by running:

```bash
taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-quickstart quickstart-project 
```

2. Create the file `./taqueria/.env

3. Get your Pinata JWT token from your [Pinata account](`https://app.pinata.cloud/signin`)

4. Add the token to the `.env` file you created:

```shell
pinataJwtToken=eyJhbGc...
```

5. Start the Taqueria project by running the start script:

```shell
npm run start:taqueria:local
```

6. Apply the Provisions

```shell
npm run apply
```

7. Start the dApp:

```shell
npm run start:app
```

Use the Dapp (served in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) by connecting a wallet and using the web UI
