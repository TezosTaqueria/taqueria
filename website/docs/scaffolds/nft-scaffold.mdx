:::warning
The NFT-Scaffold project is currently in alpha. It is not ready for production use and will be undergoing frequent updates as we work to implement Taqueria State and other features that have not yet been released
:::

## Quickstart

In a rush? You can follow the steps below to get up and running immediatley:

### Scaffold and Initialize the Project

1. `taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-nft nft-scaffold`
1. `cd nft-scaffold`
1. `npm run setup`
1. `cd taqueria`
1. `touch .env`
1. Get your Pinata JWT token from your [Pinata account](https://app.pinata.cloud/signin)
1. Insert the JWT from Pinata into the .env file `echo "pinataJwtToken=eyJhbGc..." >> .env`
1. `cd ..`
1. `npm run start:taqueria:local`
1. `npm run apply`
1. `npm run start:app`

## Overview

Mostly Rick/someone else knowledgeable about this should write this section

## Requirements

- Taqueria v0.20.2 or later
- Docker v20.10.12 or later
- Node.js v16.17.1 or later
- Temple Wallet (can be found [here](https://templewallet.com/))
- A funded testnet account (instructions [here](https://taqueria.io/docs/config/networks/#faucets))

## Using the Project

# Rick/someone else to define what the intended workflow is

The intended workflow for this project is as follows:

1. 

## Project Overview

### Scaffold the Project

This project is available as a Taqueria scaffold. To create a new project from this scaffold, run the following command:

```shell
taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-nft nft-scaffold
```

This will clone the NFT scaffold project into a directory called `nft-scaffold`

### Project Setup 

1. Change into the `/taqueria` directory inside the newly created project directory:

```shell
cd nft-scaffold/taqueria
```

1. Create the file `.env` inside the `/taqueria` directory

```shell
touch .env
```

4. Get your Pinata JWT token from your [Pinata account](https://app.pinata.cloud/signin)

5. Add the token to the `.env` file you created:

```shell
echo "pinataJwtToken=eyJhbGc..." >> .env
```

6. Start the Taqueria project by running the start script:

```shell
npm run start:taqueria:local
```

:::note
Taqueria's provisioning system is work-in-progress. However, the provisioning system prototype will closely resemble the version that will be shipped with Taqueria later this year
:::

7. Apply the Provisions

```shell
npm run apply
```

8. Start the dApp:

```shell
npm run start:app
```

Use the Dapp (served in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) by connecting a wallet and using the web UI
