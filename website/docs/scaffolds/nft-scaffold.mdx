:::warning
The NFT-Scaffold project is currently in alpha. It is not ready for production use and will be undergoing frequent updates as we work to implement Taqueria State and other features that have not yet been released
:::

## Project Setup 

1. Scaffold the project by running:

```bash
taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-nft nft-quickstart
```

2. Change into the `/taqueria` directory inside the newly created project directory:

```shell
cd nft-quickstart/taqueria
```

3. Create the file `.env` inside the `/taqueria` directory

```shell
touch .env
```

4. Get your Pinata JWT token from your [Pinata account](https://app.pinata.cloud/signin)

5. Add the token to the `.env` file you created:

```shell
echo "pinataJwtToken=eyJhbGc..." >> .env
```

6. Start the Taqueria project by running the start script:

```shell
npm run start:taqueria:local
```

:::note
Taqueria's provisioning system is work-in-progress. However, the provisioning system prototype will closely resemble the version that will be shipped with Taqueria later this year
:::

7. Apply the Provisions

```shell
npm run apply
```

8. Start the dApp:

```shell
npm run start:app
```

Use the Dapp (served in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) by connecting a wallet and using the web UI
