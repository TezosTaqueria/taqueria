## Quickstart

In a rush? Get up and going immediately wit the following steps:

1. Scaffold the project by running:

```bash
taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-quickstart quickstart-project 
```

2. Run the Setup Script (from project root):

```bash
npm run setup
```

3. Use the Dapp (served in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) by connecting a wallet and using the web UI

## Overview

Taqueria provides a [starter project](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-quickstart) that you can use to get up and running quickly by using the `taq scaffold` command

This project is a full stack dapp which includes: 
- A React app frontend
- The [Beacon Wallet](https://www.walletbeacon.io/) integration 
- A Taqueria project with the required smart contracts

This tutorial will walk you through the process of scaffolding the `taqueria-scaffold-quickstart` project right from Taqueria and getting the project up and running on your local machine, and give you an understanding of how the project is structured so you can start modifying it to suit your needs

Things you will accomplish:
- Scaffold the `taqueria-scaffold-quickstart` project from the CLI
- Install dependencies, build, and start up the app
- Understand how Taqueria plugins are used implicitly
- Learn how the Taqueria Type Generator plugin works with Taquito on the front end
- Connect a wallet via Beacon, and operate the dapp

## Requirements

To successfully follow this tutorial, you must ensure that:
- The Taqueria CLI binary has been [installed](../getting-started/installation.mdx) locally and is available in your terminal `$PATH` 
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed and registered in your terminal, and that the Docker daemon is currently running
- You are using [Node.js v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later

:::caution
Currently the Taqueria VS Code Extension does not support the scaffold command. For best results, run the commands in this tutorial from the CLI
:::

## Scaffolding the Quickstart Project

Taqueria provides a task, `taq scaffold`, which creates a new project locally from a scaffold project located in a git repo. Taqueria provides a project called `taqueria-scaffold-quickstart` which will be used in this tutorial

The command for the scaffold task has this structure: `taq scaffold <repo-url> [project-name]`. When run, Taqueria will create a new Taqueria project in the `[project-name]` directory, and clone the `<repo-url>` into that project directory

Run the following to scaffold the `taqueria-scaffold-quickstart` project into the `quickstart-project` directory:
```bash
taq scaffold https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria-scaffold-quickstart quickstart-project 
```

## Understanding the Project

### Project Structure

Now that the project has been scaffolded, you can see the project structure in the `quickstart-project` directory by changing directories:
```bash
cd quickstart-project
```
then listing the contents of the directory:
```bash
ls -al
```

This will give you an output that looks something this:
```
-rw-r--r--   1 demoUser README.md
drwxr-xr-x   9 demoUser app
drwxr-xr-x   5 demoUser taqueria
-rw-r--r--   1 demoUser package.json
-rw-r--r--   1 demoUser package-lock.json
```

As you can see, there are two executable directories, `app` and `taqueria`. The `app` directory contains the frontend React app, and the `taqueria` directory contains the Taqueria project which includes the smart contracts and Taqueria plugins

### Use of Node.js

This project uses multiple instances of Nodejs to build and run the project in a simple and easy way

There are 3 node apps in total in this project:
- The React frontend app that lives in '/app'
- The Taqueria project located in `/taqueria`
- The project root itself

Each directory is a Node app which includes with a `package.json` file and a `package-lock.json` file. You will notice that the `package.json` file in the `app` and `taqueria` directories are specific to each app, containing the dependencies, settings, and scripts required for each app

:::note
The `package-lock.json` file contains the dependencies for each project, and is used to ensure consistency. You should generally not edit this file directly
:::

#### App Specific Settings

If you open the package.json file, you will see the node configuration required for each project

Taqueria `package.json` from `/taqueria` dir looks like this:
```json
{
  "private": true,
  "name": "@local/contract",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "taq compile && taq generate types ../app/src/types",
    "start:local": "npm run build && taq start sandbox local && taq deploy",
    "stop:local": "taq stop sandbox local"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@taqueria/plugin-contract-types": "latest",
    "@taqueria/plugin-flextesa": "latest",
    "@taqueria/plugin-ligo": "latest",
    "@taqueria/plugin-taquito": "latest",
    "@taquito/taquito": "^11.2.0"
  }
}
```

While the React app `package.json` from `/app` dir looks like this:
```json
{
  "name": "example-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
    "test": "react-app-rewired test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ...
    ],
    "development": [
      ...
    ]
  },
  "proxy": "http://localhost:20000"
}
```

As you can see, each project has a different set of dependencies, scripts, and settings. The `package.json` files are used to specify the dependencies, scripts, and settings for each project. This means each project can be built, started, and used independently

#### Root Project Settings

The `package.json` file in the project root is used to bundle both apps together into a single node app that can be run from a single command. It contains only the scripts needed to run both apps and looks like this:
```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "npm run setup:taqueria && npm run setup:app",
    "setup:taqueria": "cd ./taqueria && npm install && taq init",
    "setup:app": "cd ./app && npm install",
    "start": "npm run build:taqueria && npm run start:app",
    "build:taqueria": "cd ./taqueria && npm run build",
    "start:app": "cd ./app && npm run start",
    "start:local": "npm run start:taqueria:local && npm run start:app",
    "start:taqueria:local": "cd ./taqueria && npm run start:local",
    "stop:local": "npm run stop:taqueria:local",
    "stop:taqueria:local": "cd ./taqueria && npm run stop:local"
  }
}
```

## Building and Starting the Project

The root Node project contains `setup` and `start` scripts which can be run together on a single line to build, deploy, and launch the dapp. This process involves the following steps: 
1. Install npm dependencies
2. Run the required commands to build and deploy the Taqueria project
3. Start up the React app

From the root of the project, run the following command to build and start the project:
```bash
npm run setup && npm run start
```
This will result in your browser opening to a simple webpage that has a `connect` button for the Beacon wallet integration

It's important here to understand what steps occur implicitly during this so you can understand how the different plugins and files are in Taqueria

### Building and Deploying the Taqueria Project

If you inspect the scripts in `/taqueria/package.json`, you will see the following actions occur on the Taqueria project implicitly when the setup command is run:
1. Build the `/taqueria` NPM project: `npm run build` - installs npm dependencies, including Taqueria plugins
2. Compile the ligo contract: `taq compile` - uses the LIGO Taqueria plugin to compile the smart contract located in `/taqueria/contracts`, outputing compiled Michelson `.tz` files in the `/artifacts` directory
3. Generates TS types: `taq generate types` - uses the Taqueria Type Generator plugin to generate TS types from the compiled smart contract, and install them into the React app (`/app/types`) for use with Taquito in the frontend

#### Compiling the Smart Contract

#### Type Generation



## Using the Dapp 

### Connecting a Wallet

### Interacting with the Smart Contract



## How Generated Types are Applied 
Detail:
- running from taq
- understanding artifacts
- importing and using in the front-end (Using types in Taquito calls)
