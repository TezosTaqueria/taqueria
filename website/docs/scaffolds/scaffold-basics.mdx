title: Scaffold Basics
---

Taqueria provides support for scaffold projects. These projects offer a quick and easy way to clone and launch Taqueria projects that can be used for learning or as a starting point for your own projects

Scaffolds are Taqueria projects that come with Taqueria already installed and configured. They can be accessed directly in Taqueria with the `taq scaffold` task which clones, initializes, and sets-up the project with a single command. Some scaffolds are full stack projects, while others are focused on smart contract development

## The `taq scaffold` task

Scaffolding is done through the `taq scaffold` task 

:::note
This task is hidden when the current working directory is already a Taqueria project
:::

The structure of the task is:

```shell
taq scaffold <scaffoldUrl> [destinationDir]
```

## Building and Starting Scaffolds

During the scaffolding process, a setup script is run. This will install the required dependencies and set-up the project. To run the setup script manually, change into the project directory and run:

```shell
npm run setup
```

To start the project (can be different depending on which scaffold), run the following command that is applicable to the scaffolded project:

```shell
npm run start
```

Or,

```shell
npm run start:app
```

## Available scaffolds
