:::note
The Taqueria VS Code Extension provides direct access to Taqueria tasks. Under the hood, the VS Code Extension makes calls to the CLI, so you can be assured the behaviour of tasks will remain consistent regardless of whether they are executed from a terminal or the extension. The steps in this guide are for using the Taqueria CLI, but you can also run the commands from the Taqueria extension if you prefer
