:::note
This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or originating to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](docs/plugins/plugin-flextesa)

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets which can then be targeted by Taqueria commands through the use of Taqueria environments

### The Default Network Configuration

Named network configurations are stored as key/value pairs in the `network` property using the network name as the key

This example shows the configuration for the default network named `ghostnet` that's already setup for you:

```json
"network": {
    "ghostnet": {
        "label": "ghostnet",
        "rpcUrl": "https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com"
    }
},
```

We also have the corresponding environment, called `testing`, that targets the above network setup for you and it looks like the following:
```json
"testing": {
    "networks": [
        "ghostnet"
    ],
    "sandboxes": []
}
```

To use this network, simply include `--env testing` after each taq command.

### Adding a new network configuration

You may manually add another network configuration following the format of the default network. For example:
```
"network": {
    "ghostnet": {
        "label": "ghostnet",
        "rpcUrl": "https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com"
    },
    "customnet": {
        "label": "customnet",
        "rpcUrl": <url of the network>
    }
},
```

Then create a new environment (you may follow the format of the environment called `testing` above) and add this target to that environment

## Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all protocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+)

:::note
Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release

## Targeting a Network

Taqueria uses [Environments](/docs/config/environments) to target a specific network or sandbox. An environment is a named collection of network configurations which can be passed to the CLI using the `--env` flag

To target the `ghostnet` network we configured above using the `testing` environment, simply run the following command:
```shell
taq originate <contractName> --env testing
```
