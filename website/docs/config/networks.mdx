title: Testnet Configuration

:::note
This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or originating to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](../plugins/plugin-flextesa.mdx/)

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets (including faucet keys) which can then be targeted by Taqueria commands through the use of Taqueria environments

To work with Taqueria networks, these are the basic steps you need to take:
1. Add a network configuration to the Taqueria `.taq/config.json` file
2. Add a faucet key
3. Add the created network to an environment
4. Target the network in Taqueria by passing the environment name to the CLI command (ie. `taq originate --env testing`)

## Requirements

:::note
Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release
:::

To configure and use a Taqueria network, you will require the following:

1. Configuration details for the network you wish to target (Can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
2. The [Taquito plugin](../plugins/plugin-taquito.mdx/) (Used for originating to a network)

### Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all protocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+) 

Ghostnet should be the default testnet you use since it will automatically handle protocol upgrades as they happen

## Configuration

:::note
The network configuration for various protocols, as well as the faucet for each can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/).
:::

To configure a network for use, you will need to configure the network, and then add that network to an environment. To illustrate the configuration of a network, we will use [ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ithaca-testnet/), a long running Tezos test network as an example in this document and will configure a network named `ghostnet`, and an environment named `testing`

Taqueria does not have a default network configured, so a freshly initialized project will have a `config.json` file that looks like this:
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtJakart2xVj7pYXJBXrqHgd82rdkLey5ZeeGwDgPp9rhQUbSqY",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {},
    "accounts": {
        "bob": "3_000_000_000",
        "alice": "3_000_000_000",
        "john": "3_000_000_000",
        "jane": "3_000_000_000",
        "joe": "3_000_000_000"
    }
}
```

### Network Configuration

The first step is to add a named network configuration to your `config.json` file

Add the following entry ("ghostnet": {...}) to the `network` property::
```json
{
   "network":{
      "ghostnet":{
         "label":"Ghostnet Protocol Testnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz",
         "protocol":"PtJakart2xVj7pYXJBXrqHgd82rdkLey5ZeeGwDgPp9rhQUbSqY",
         "faucet":{
            "pkh": "",
            "mnemonic":  "",
            "email": "",
            "password": "",
            "amount": "",
            "activation_code": ""
        }
      }
   }
```

The above provides a configuration for a testnet called _ghostnet_, a long-lived network that is kept up-to-date with the latest protocol revisions, and is a safe default for most projects.

:::note
The information for `rpcUrl` and`protocol` are taken from the page [https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about)
:::

### Faucets 

In order to interact with the testnet, you will need an account funded with some Tez.

:::note
We're working on an improved workflow for funding testnet accounts. For now, please follow the steps below.
:::

1. Go [here](https://resilience-me.github.io/Tezos-paper-wallet/) and click _Generate_.
2. From step #2, copy the Public Key and set as the value for "pkh" in the faucet configuration.
3. From step #2, copy the Private Key (which is actually a mnemonic seed phrase) and set as the value for "mnemonic" in the faucet configuration.

Your network configuration should now look like the following:
```json
{
   "network":{
      "ghostnet":{
         "label":"Ghostnet Protocol Testnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz",
         "protocol":"PtJakart2xVj7pYXJBXrqHgd82rdkLey5ZeeGwDgPp9rhQUbSqY",
         "faucet":{
            "pkh": "tz1SrwfccRGEM74T8GLXVzPZAaVk7WjoMPok",
		    "mnemonic": "dice must lawsuit remain december shed scorpion member loud subject mixture fan trust beauty crush",
            "email": "",
            "password": "",
            "amount": "",
            "activation_code": ""
        }
      }
   }
```
4. Go to teztnets.xyz, click on the link for the faucet of the desired testnet, and then request to have funds sent to your public key hash address (which would be tz1SrwfccRGEM74T8GLXVzPZAaVk7WjoMPok in your example above).

### Environment Configuration

The final step in configuration is to add the network to an environment. In this example, we will create a new environment named `testing` which will contain the `ghost` network

To do this, find the `environment` property in your `config.json` file. By default it will look something like this:
```json
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
    },
```

Add a new environment named `testing`, and add the named network `ghostnet` to its `networks` array:
```json
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
        "testing": {
            "networks": [
                "ghostnet"
            ],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
```

:::note

:::

### Finished Configuration

At this point, you should have a fully configured network named `ghostnet` which is configured to target [ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about) using a faucet, and an environment named `testing` which can be used to target the network from the CLI

Your `config.json` file should look something like this: 
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
        "testing": {
            "networks": [
                "ghostnet"
            ],
            "sandboxes": [],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtJakart2xVj7pYXJBXrqHgd82rdkLey5ZeeGwDgPp9rhQUbSqY",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {
        "ghostnet": {
        "label": "ghostnet",
        "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz",
        "protocol":"PtJakart2xVj7pYXJBXrqHgd82rdkLey5ZeeGwDgPp9rhQUbSqY",
        "faucet": {
            "pkh": "tz1SrwfccRGEM74T8GLXVzPZAaVk7WjoMPok",
            "mnemonic":  "dice must lawsuit remain december shed scorpion member loud subject mixture fan trust beauty crush",
            "email": "",
            "password": "",
            "amount": "",
            "activation_code": ""
        }
    },
    "accounts": {
        "bob": "3_000_000_000",
        "alice": "3_000_000_000",
        "john": "3_000_000_000",
        "jane": "3_000_000_000",
        "joe": "3_000_000_000"
    }
}
```

## Targeting a Network

Taqueria uses [Environments](/docs/config/environments) to target a specific network or sandbox. An environment is a named collection of network configurations which can be passed to the CLI using the `--env` flag

To target the `ghostnet` network we configured above using the `testing` environment, simply run the following command:
```shell
taq originate --env testing
```
