title: Testnet and Mainnet Configuration

:::note
This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets and mainnet. If you are looking for information on running or originating to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](docs/plugins/plugin-flextesa)

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets which can then be targeted by Taqueria commands through the use of Taqueria environments

### The Default Network Configuration

Named network configurations are stored as key/value pairs in the `network` property using the network name as the key

This example shows the configuration for the default network named `ghostnet` that's already setup for you:

```json
"network": {
    "ghostnet": {
        "label": "ghostnet",
        "rpcUrl": "https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com"
    }
},
```

We also have the corresponding environment, called `testing`, that targets the above network setup for you and it looks like the following:
```json
"testing": {
    "networks": [
        "ghostnet"
    ],
    "sandboxes": []
}
```

To use this network, simply include `--env testing` after each taq command.

### Adding a new network configuration

You may manually add another network configuration following the format of the default network. For example:
```
"network": {
    "ghostnet": {
        "label": "ghostnet",
        "rpcUrl": "https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com"
    },
    "customnet": {
        "label": "customnet",
        "rpcUrl": <url of the network>
    }
},
```

Then create a new environment (you may follow the format of the environment called `testing` above) and add this target to that environment

## Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all protocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+)

## Targeting a Network

Taqueria uses [Environments](/docs/config/environments) to target a specific network or sandbox. An environment is a named collection of network configurations which can be passed to the CLI using the `--env` flag

To target the `ghostnet` network we configured above using the `testing` environment, simply run the following command:
```shell
taq originate <contractName> --env testing
```

## Deploying and Transferring with Mainnet

Configuring a mainnet is quite similar to configuring a teztnet with one difference. Users must also create an account, with the mnemonic specified, within the network in order to interact with mainnet. See the example below:

:::danger
Improvements are on the way. However, we currently only support signing in memory and we require a mnemonic to be written in the config file, so do not commit this file or delete the mnemonic before doing so). This is not the safest way to interact with mainnet so proceed with caution
:::

```
"mainnet": {
    "label": "mainnet",
    "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.api.tez.ie",
    "accounts": {
        "tempUser": {
            "mnemonic": <12-24 words mnemonic generated via a wallet>
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
By default, Taqueria will create an environment called `production` that point to this network upon executing `taq init`. For old projects, add the following to the `environment` field of the config file:
:::

```
"production": {
    "networks": [
        "mainnet"
    ],
    "sandboxes": []
}
```

To interact with mainnet using `tempUser`, users must include the `--env` and the `--sender` flags. E.g. `taq deploy counter --env production --sender tempUser`
