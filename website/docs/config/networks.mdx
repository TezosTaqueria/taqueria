title: Testnet Configuration
---

:::note
This document details the configuration and use of Tezos testnets. If you are looking for information on running or originating to a sandbox, please see the Flextesa documentation [here](../plugins/plugin-flextesa.mdx/)
:::

## Introduction

Taqueria provides support to interact with Tezos networks in a simplified and streamlined manner. Taqueria provides a centralized configuration for testnets (including faucet keys) which can then be targeted by Taqueria commands through the use of Taqueria environments

To work with Taqueria networks, these are the basic steps you need to take:
1. Add a network configuration to the Taqueria `.taq/config.json` file
2. Add a faucet key
3. Add the created network to an environment
4. Target the network in Taqueria by passing the environment name to the CLI command (ie. `taq originate --env testing`)

## Requirements

:::note
Currently Taqueria only supports testnets. Support for mainnet will be added in a future release
:::

To configure and use a Taqueria network, you will require the following:

1. Configuration details for the network you wish to target (Can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
2. A faucet key for the network you wish to target (Also found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/))
3. The [Taquito plugin](../plugins/plugin-taquito.mdx/) (Used for originating to a network)

### Supported Protocols

Taqueria will support all protocols available on the [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/) site. If you notice an issue with a recent protocol update, please report it as a bug [here](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+) 

Ghostnet should be the default testnet you use since it will automatically handle protocol upgrades as they happen

## Configuration

:::note
The network configuration for various protocols, as well as the faucet for each can be found at [teztnets.xyz](https://teztnets.xyz/).
:::

To configure a network for use, you will need to configure the network, and then add that network to an environment. To illustrate the configuration of a network, we will use [ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ithaca-testnet/), a long running Tezos test network as an example in this document and will configure a network named `ghostnet`, and an environment named `testing`

Taqueria does not have a default network configured, so a freshly initialized project will have a `config.json` file that looks like this:
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtKathmankSpLLDALzWw7CGD2j2MtyveTwboEYokqUCP4a1LxMg",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {},
    "accounts": {
        "bob": "3_000_000_000",
        "alice": "3_000_000_000",
        "john": "3_000_000_000",
        "jane": "3_000_000_000",
        "joe": "3_000_000_000"
    }
}
```

### Network Configuration

The first step is to add a named network configuration to your `config.json` file

Add the following entry ("testing": {...}) to the `network` property::
```json
{
   "network":{
      "ghostnet":{
         "label":"Ghostnet Protocol Testnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz",
         "protocol":"PtKathmankSpLLDALzWw7CGD2j2MtyveTwboEYokqUCP4a1LxMg",
         "faucet":{  }
      }
   }
```
:::note
The information for `rpcUrl` and`protocol` are taken from the page [https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about)
:::

### Faucets 

In order to interact with the network, you will need some Tez in an account. The way this is done on Tezos is to provide a faucet key. The faucet key provides Tez on a particular testnet, which can then be used to interact with the network

To get your own unique faucet key for testing, visit [https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-faucet](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-faucet), and complete the captcha validation. Once this is done, you will see the faucet key shown as a JSON object

To add the faucet key to your Taqueria project, simply copy and paste the JSON object into the `faucet` field of the network configuration shown above

Your `network` property should now look something like this:
```json
{
   "network":{
      "ghostnet":{
         "label":"Ghostnet Protocol Testnet",
         "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz",
         "protocol":"PtKathmankSpLLDALzWw7CGD2j2MtyveTwboEYokqUCP4a1LxMg",
         "faucet":{
            "key": {
	            "pkh": "tz1cEqJmGnzcGDa9cyj437RmLL5GYPiawiUc",
                "mnemonic": [
                    "other",
                    "nerve",
                    "awkward",
                    "jaguar",
                    "anchor",
                    "conduct",
                    "drill",
                    "upon",
                    "roof",
                    "planet",
                    "glass",
                    "among",
                    "turkey",
                    "also",
                    "urban"
                ],
                "email": "kgwzskbc.tootktlz@teztnets.xyz",
                "password": "JTMMX6FPNM",
                "amount": "2006437205",
                "activation_code": "50fe648444288c8dd1fe1e976ca26160536fda94"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### Environment Configuration

The final step in configuration is to add the network to an environment. In this example, we will create a new environment named `testing` which will contain the `ghost` network

To do this, find the `environment` property in your `config.json` file. By default it will look something like this:
```json
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
    },
```

Add a new environment named `testing`, and add the named network `ghostnet` to its `networks` array:
```json
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
        "testing": {
            "networks": [
                "ghostnet"
            ],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
```

:::

### Finished Configuration

At this point, you should have a fully configured network named `ghostnet` which is configured to target [ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet-about) using a faucet, and an environment named `testing` which can be used to target the network from the CLI

Your `config.json` file should look something like this: 
```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {}
        },
        "testing": {
            "networks": [
                "ghostnet"
            ],
            "sandboxes": [],
            "storage": {}
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "PtKathmankSpLLDALzWw7CGD2j2MtyveTwboEYokqUCP4a1LxMg",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {
        "ghostnet":{
            "label":"Ghostnet Protocol Testnet",
            "rpcUrl":"https://rpc.ghostnet.teztnets.xyz",
            "protocol":"PtKathmankSpLLDALzWw7CGD2j2MtyveTwboEYokqUCP4a1LxMg",
            "faucet":{
               "key": {
                   "pkh": "tz1cEqJmGnzcGDa9cyj437RmLL5GYPiawiUc",
                   "mnemonic": [
                       "other",
                       "nerve",
                       "awkward",
                       "jaguar",
                       "anchor",
                       "conduct",
                       "drill",
                       "upon",
                       "roof",
                       "planet",
                       "glass",
                       "among",
                       "turkey",
                       "also",
                       "urban"
                   ],
                   "email": "kgwzskbc.tootktlz@teztnets.xyz",
                   "password": "JTMMX6FPNM",
                   "amount": "2006437205",
                   "activation_code": "50fe648444288c8dd1fe1e976ca26160536fda94"
               }
            }
         }
      }
    },
    "accounts": {
        "bob": "3_000_000_000",
        "alice": "3_000_000_000",
        "john": "3_000_000_000",
        "jane": "3_000_000_000",
        "joe": "3_000_000_000"
    }
}
```

## Targeting a Network

Taqueria uses [Environments](/docs/config/environments) to target a specific network or sandbox. An environment is a named collection of network configurations which can be passed to the CLI using the `--env` flag

To target the `ghostnet` network we configured above using the `testing` environment, simply run the following command:
```shell
taq originate --env testing
```
