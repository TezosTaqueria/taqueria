title: Environment Configuration

## Overview

Taqueria Environments provide a powerful and flexible way to develop Tezos projects in multiple contexts. Environments can target one or more testnets or sandboxes.

:::note
To target an environment for a stateful task such as `taq originate`, add the `--env` flag with the name of the environment you would like to target. For example, to target an environment named `kathmandu_env` for an origination, you would use the following command:
```
taq originate --env kathmandu_env
```

## The Default Environment

Taqueria generates a default environment for each project named `development`. This environment has the following properties:

```json
"environment": {
    "default": "development",
    "development": {
        "networks": [],
        "sandboxes": []
    }
```

## Adding a New Environment

Environment configurations are added as key/value pairs to the main `environment` object using the format:

```json
environmentName : { environmentConfig }
```

Environment configurations have the following properties:

- `networks`: An array of network names that the environment should be targeted for
- `sandboxes`: An array of sandbox names that the environment should be targeted for

### The `networks` Property

The networks property holds a comma separated list of named networks. The networks referenced must be configured in the `network` property of `config.json`. You can add zero or more networks to an environment

### The `sandboxes` Property

The sandboxes property holds a comma separated list of named sandboxes. The sandboxes referenced must be configured in the `sandbox` property of `config.json`. You can add zero or more sandboxes to an environment
