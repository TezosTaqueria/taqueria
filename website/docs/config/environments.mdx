title: Environment Configuration

## Overview

Taqueria Environments provide a powerful and flexible way to develop Tezos projects in multiple contexts. These environments can be used throughout the life cycle of a project from development to production.


:::note
To target an environment for a stateful task such as `taq originate`, add the `--env` flag with the name of the environment you would like to target. For example, to target an environment named `kathmandu_env` for an origination, you would use the following command:
```
taq originate --env kathmandu_env
```
:::

## Example Environments

Environments are declared in `.taq/config.json`

```json
    "environmentDefault": "development",
    "environments": {
        "development": {
            "type": "flextesa",
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox"
        },
        "testing": {
            "type": "simple",
            "label": "ghostnet",
            "rpcUrl": "https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com"
        },
        "production": {
            "type": "simple",
            "label": "mainnet",
            "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.api.tez.ie"
        }
    }
```

The above example shows 3 environments: `development`, `testing`, and `production`. 

Each environment has a type. The `development` environment is `flextesa` which uses the flextesa plugin for a local sandbox. The `testing` and `production` environments are both the `simple` type which use only the rpcUrl. 

Other environment types can be created with a plugin and it can define additional environment fields as needed.

## The Default Environment

In the above example, the default environment is `development`. For most taq commands the default environment will be used unless the `--env` flag is provided.

## Local Config

Each environment also has a `config.local...` file. 

Going back to the example `config.json` above, it has three environments. So, each would have their own `config.local...` file:

- config.local.development.json
- config.local.testing.json
- config.local.production.json

These local config files are intended to store custom settings that are specific to a single developer's context. 

For example, when deploying a contract to a sandbox or a test environment, the `config.local...` file could contain the address of a contract deployed by a developer. Since each developer working on the same project would each have their own `config.local...` file for each environment, they will have an isolated context when working.

The `config.local...` files should be excluded from git commits, and are listed in the `.gitignore` by default.

On the other hand, the main `config.json` contains settings that belong to the project itself and should be shared by all developers working on that project since those settings are common.

## Deploying and Transferring with Mainnet

:::danger
Improvements are on the way. However, we currently only support signing in memory and we require a mnemonic to be written in the config file, so do not commit this file or delete the mnemonic before doing so. This is not the safest way to interact with mainnet so proceed with caution
:::

Add the `accounts` field to the `config.local.production.json` file. For example:
```
{
    "networkName": "mainnet",
    "accounts": {
        "tempUser": {
            "mnemonic": <12-24 words mnemonic generated via a wallet>
        }
    }
}
```

To interact with mainnet using `tempUser`, users must include the `--env` and the `--sender` flags. E.g. `taq deploy counter --env production --sender tempUser`
