title: Environment Configuration

## Overview

Taqueria Environments provide a powerful and flexible way to develop Tezos projects in multiple contexts. These environments can be used throughout the life cycle of a project from development to production.


:::note
To target an environment for a stateful task such as `taq originate`, add the `--env` flag with the name of the environment you would like to target. For example, to target an environment named `kathmandu_env` for an origination, you would use the following command:
```
taq originate --env kathmandu_env
```
:::

## Example Environments

Environments are declared in `.taq/config.json`

```json
    "environmentDefault": "development",
    "environments": {
        "development": {
            "type": "flextesa",
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox"
        },
        "testing": {
            "type": "simple",
            "label": "ghostnet",
            "rpcUrl": "https://ghostnet.ecadinfra.com"
        },
        "production": {
            "type": "simple",
            "label": "mainnet",
            "rpcUrl": "https://mainnet.api.tez.ie"
        }
    }
```

The above example shows 3 environments: `development`, `testing`, and `production`. 

Each environment has a type. The `development` environment is `flextesa` which uses the flextesa plugin for a local sandbox. The `testing` and `production` environments are both the `simple` type which use only the rpcUrl. 

Other environment types can be created with a plugin and it can define additional environment fields as needed.

## The Default Environment

In the above example, the default environment is `development`. For most taq commands the default environment will be used unless the `--env` flag is provided.

## Local Config

Each environment also has a `config.local...` file. 

Going back to the example `config.json` above, it has three environments. So, each would have their own `config.local...` file:

- config.local.development.json
- config.local.testing.json
- config.local.production.json

These local config files are intended to store custom settings that are specific to a single developer's context. 

For example, when deploying a contract to a sandbox or a test environment, the `config.local...` file could contain the address of a contract deployed by a developer. Since each developer working on the same project would each have their own `config.local...` file for each environment, they will have an isolated context when working.

The `config.local...` files should be excluded from git commits, and are listed in the `.gitignore` by default.

On the other hand, the main `config.json` contains settings that belong to the project itself and should be shared by all developers working on that project since those settings are common.
