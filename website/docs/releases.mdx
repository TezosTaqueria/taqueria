|Release Page | [v0.4.0](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/releases/tag/v0.4.0) |

## Summary of Impactful Changes

- Taqueria State 
- Project level named implicit accounts * *breaking change* *
- @taqueria/plugin-taquito: stateful `originate` operation now available
- @taqueria/plugin-tezos-client: added support for invoking endpoints by annotation
- Taqueria protocol now uses schema based type enforcement (Zod)

## New features

## JEST Plugin

Partitions - directories with their own JEST config (so you can segment tests into different buckets:  e.g. type / )

Unlimited number of partitions: by default there are no partitions

Treate one by running `taq test -init` -> creates a partition using the folder specifed in [jestTestsRootDir] 

Config can be overridden by setting `jestTestsRootDir` in `taqueria.config.js`

Create tests in that folder `tests/example.spec.ts`

```
describe('Jest example', () => {
    test('This is a test. Nothing more; nothing less', () => {
        expect('tests').toContain('fun')
    })
})
```

`taq test [partitionName]`

Global Config:
- `./.taq/jest.config.js`

implicitly:
- if no provision created, `taq test [dirName]`


### Taqueria State

Taqueria now tracks and stores each task executed, along with any returned values. This data is is stored in a new auto-generated file named `development-state.json` which is referred to as `Taqueria State`

This file is JSON encoded and is stored in the `.taq` directory of the project. Records follow the format:

```json
        "@taqueria/plugin-taquito.deploy.1654212273655": {
            "time": 1654212273655,
            "output": [
                {
                    "contract": "test.tz",
                    "address": "KT1ShFinJPuXqdAUXomKAB8t6s3q6JGjAN2G",
                    "destination": "local"
                }
            ]
        }
```

:::note
At this time, only the `originate` task is supported but full support for operations and additional plugin tasks is coming soon
:::

### State API

A new package `@taqueria-state-js` has been added to the project which provides a simple interface for working with the persistant state 

To use the package, import it into any JS or TS file:

```js
import loadProject from "@taqueria/state-js"
```

Once imported, you can retrieve the list of originations like this:

```js
const {getOriginations} = await loadProject()
const results = getOriginations("increment.tz")
console.log(results)
```

To retrieve the most recently deployed version of a contract and the address:


```js
const [latest] = getOriginations("increment.tz")
```

To retrieve a list of all contracts deployed to the sandbox `local`:

```js
const results = getOriginations()
     .filter(contract => contract.destination === "local")
```

### Implicit accounts

:::warning
This release makes a breaking change to the schema of `config.json`
:::

Taqueria now allows you to be declarative when naming your implicit accounts and the desired balance for each. These accounts are declared at the root level in config.json. Previously, accounts were in each sandbox configuration

Taqueria now defines named implicit accounts at the root level in `config.json`. Previously, accounts were defined separatley in each sandbox configuration

The basic structure of `config.json` is now:

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [

    ],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {
                "example.tz": 42
            }
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "Psithaca2MLRFYargivpo7YvUr7wUDqyxrdhC5CQq78mRvimz6A",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {},
    "accounts": {
        "bob": "3_000_000_000",
        "alice": "3_000_000_000",
        "john": "3_000_000_000",
        "jane": "3_000_000_000",
        "joe": "3_000_000_000"
    }
}
```

These accounts will be created and funded automatically when a sandbox starts. After starting a sandbox, you will see the defined accounts appear in the configuration:

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "plugins": [
    ],
    "contractsDir": "contracts",
    "testsDir": "tests",
    "artifactsDir": "artifacts",
    "environment": {
        "default": "development",
        "development": {
            "networks": [],
            "sandboxes": [
                "local"
            ],
            "storage": {
                "example.tz": 42
            }
        }
    },
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "accounts": {
                "bob": {
                    "encryptedKey": "edpkurPsQ8eUApnLUJ9ZPDvu98E8VNj4KtJa1aZr16Cr5ow5VHKnz4",
                    "publicKeyHash": "tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6",
                    "secretKey": "unencrypted:edsk3RFfvaFaxbHx8BMtEW1rKQcPtDML3LXjNqMNLCzC3wLC1bWbAt"
                },
                "alice": {
                    "encryptedKey": "edpkvGfYw3LyB1UcCahKQk4rF2tvbMUk8GFiTuMjL75uGXrpvKXhjn",
                    "publicKeyHash": "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb",
                    "secretKey": "unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq"
                }
            },
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "Psithaca2MLRFYargivpo7YvUr7wUDqyxrdhC5CQq78mRvimz6A",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
    "network": {},
    "accounts": {
        "bob": "3_000_000_000",
        "alice": "3_000_000_000"
    }
}
```

:::note
To set a default account for a sandbox, you must define it explicitly in the sandbox config:

```json
    "sandbox": {
        "local": {
            "accounts": {
                "default": "bob",
                "bob": {
                    "encryptedKey": "edpkurPsQ8eUApnLUJ9ZPDvu98E8VNj4KtJa1aZr16Cr5ow5VHKnz4",
                    "publicKeyHash": "tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6",
                    "secretKey": "unencrypted:edsk3RFfvaFaxbHx8BMtEW1rKQcPtDML3LXjNqMNLCzC3wLC1bWbAt"
                },
                "alice": {
                    "encryptedKey": "edpkvGfYw3LyB1UcCahKQk4rF2tvbMUk8GFiTuMjL75uGXrpvKXhjn",
                    "publicKeyHash": "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb",
                    "secretKey": "unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq"
                }
            },
            "label": "Local Tezos Sandbox",
            "protocol": "Psithaca2MLRFYargivpo7YvUr7wUDqyxrdhC5CQq78mRvimz6A",
            "rpcUrl": "http://localhost:20000"
        }
    },
```

## Product Changes

### @taqueria/plugin-tezos-client - `simulate` task improved

The Tezos Client now supports invoking entrypoints by annotation. The flag `--entrypoint` has been added to the simulate task

You can now invoke an entrypoint annotated `decrement` by running the following:

```shell
taq simulate sample.tz '3' --storage 5 --entrypoint decrement
```

Previously, a raw Michelson expression was required:

```shell
taq simulate sample.tz 'Left (Left 3)' --storage 5
```

### Conceptual Changes to Note

- Taqueria now stores the project in a new auto-generated file `development-state.json` specific to the environment located in the `./.taq/` directory 
- Taqueria's ephermal state `state.json` will now be referred to as the Taqueria cache
- Implicit accounts are now defined at the root level in the `config.json` file
- The balance of these accounts is now global to the project
- On startup, a sandbox will create and fund each defined account  

### Bugfixes

- @taqueria/plugin-flextesa: Deploying multiple contracts can fail [#512](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/512)
- @taqueria/plugin-flextesa: Contract contents in sandbox deployment don't match what is printed out in console message[#707](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/707)
- @taqueria/plugin-tezos-client: Tezos client plugin storage or input value of 0 is treated as empty [#702](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taqueria/issues/702)

### Other Improvements

- MacOS runners added to CI pipeline which has enabled automated testing in MacOs environments
- E2E tests now asynchronously and in batches, up to 4x faster 
- Plugin documentation is now all built from a common source
- Dependency injection added to VS Code Extension
- Improved test coverage of VS Code Extension
