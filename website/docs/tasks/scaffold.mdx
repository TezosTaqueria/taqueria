## Overview

Taq `scaffold` is a task used to retrieve and initialize a Taqueria scaffold. Scaffolds are pre-existing Taqueria projects which are useful as a starting point for a new project, or as a learning aid. For more information about scaffolds, see the [scaffold documentation](/docs/scaffolds/scaffold-basics)

When the scaffold task is run, Taqueria does several things:

- Clones the scaffold repository 
- Removes the `.git` directory from the project
- Taq`ifies the project and generates the cache by running `taq` and `taq init` 
- Runs the setup script defined in `scaffold.json`. This will install dependencies and build the Taqueria project and dApp if there is one

Once this is done, you can run `npm run start` from the appropriate directory to start the project and start interacting with the dApp and contracts

:::note
The scaffold task will accept any valid git repository for the `<url> parameter` and will clone it as `git clone` would do. The task will also run `taq init` and `taq` on the project. However, the setup script will not be run as `scaffold.json` is unlikley to exist and there may be further steps required to get the project fully taq`ified
