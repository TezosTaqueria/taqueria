title: Flextesa Plugin
---

The Flextesa plugin provides a quick and easy way to start, stop, and query a Flextesa sandbox instance
// Does Taqueria manage the sandbox env/config?

 Flextesa is a Tezos sandbox environment that runs in Docker and provides a local Tezos node and test network. This plugin uses a docker image called `taqueria/flextesa`, which is available [here](https://tezos.gitlab.io/flextesa/)

 Once running, you can originate your smart contracts to the testnet, run tests, and make RPC calls

## Tasks

The Flextesa plugin provides the following tasks to Taqueria:
- `start sandbox`
- `stop sandbox`
- `list accounts`

## Requirements

The Flextesa plugin requires Docker v0.8.4 or later to be installed locally

Docker is available [here](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation

To install the Flextesa plugin on a Taqueria project, navigate to the project folder and run:
```shell
taq install @taqueria/plugin-flextesa
```

## Usage

This plugin provides access to a Flextesa sandbox instance which runs in a docker container on your machine. As this is a self contained environment running independently on your machine, there is a lifecycle to be aware of. In order to query or originate to a sandbox network, it must be started and running

:::note
The first time you start a sandbox, it might take several minutes to start. This is normal when starting a Flextesa image
:::

The plugin provides two lifecycle tasks: `start sandbox` and `stop sandbox`

### The `start sandbox` Task
***Coming soon***

### The `stop sandbox` Task
***Coming soon*

### The `list accounts` Task
***Coming soon***

## Plugin Configuration

This plugin stores the sandbox configuration in the `./.taq/config.json` file

***More coming soon***
