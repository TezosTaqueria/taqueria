title: Taqueria Plugins
---

Plugins are how Taqueria gets things done. Each plugin implements a specific function such as a smart contract compiler, sandbox, or test framework. A plugin will provide one or more tasks that you can use in Taqueria

Taqueria is designed to be flexible, streamlined, and customizable so plugins are installed on a per-project basis depending on the particular needs of the project

Once installed, plugins provide their functionality by exposing tasks in the Taqueria CLI. The tasks available to run on a particular project can be viewed by running the `taq --help` command in a project directory that's using Taqueria. 

:::note
If you aren't seeing tasks listed when running `taq`, make sure that you are in the correct project folder and that you have successfully installed that particular plugin on that project `taq install @taqueria/<plugin-name>`
:::

During installation, NPM packages for the plugin are downloaded into the project folder and the plugin is registered in `.taq/config.json`
