title: Typescript Code Generator Plugin
---

The TypeScript generator plugin generates TypeScript types based on a smart contractâ€™s Michelson type definitions. The generated types work with Taquito providing the developer user with type safety and an improved code authoring experience. This enables developer users (using both Taquito and Taqueria) to use static types at compile time instead of on runtime validation
