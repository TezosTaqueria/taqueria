## Jest Plugin 

The `@taqueria/plugin-jest` plugin provides the `taq test` task which provides a means to initialize Jest test directories and run Jest tests

## Requirements

- Taqueria v0.22.1 or later
- Node.js v16.17.1 or later

### Installation

To install the Jest plugin on a Taqueria project, run:

```shell
taq install @taqueria/plugin-jest
```

### Usage

:::note
The Jest plugin will automatically initialize a Jest tests folder when you run `taq test <test-folder>`

The easiest way to start using the plugin is to:

1. Create a new folder in the root of your project `tests`
2. Add one or more tests to the folder
3. Run `taq test tests`
:::


### Initializing Partitions

The Jest plugin uses partitions. These are just directories with their own JEST config but allow you to group and manage your tests with great flexibility. This allows you to segment and run tests in different buckets such as:

- By type (unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, e2e tests)
- Structural (dapp, smart contract, serverless functions)

To create a new partition (initialized test folder), run:

```shell
taq test --init
```

This will do several things:

- Create a new folder (in this case it uses the default folder `tests`)
- Create a Jest configuration in the folder
- Create a global Jest configuration file in `.taq/jest.config.js`

:::note
You can create any number of partitions. By default there are no partitions
:::

To create additional partitions, simply run:

```shell
taq test [partitionName]
```

### Running Jest tests

The `taq test [partitionName]` task will run the Jest tests associated with a particular partition

Create tests in that folder, for example creating the test file `tests/example.spec.ts`

### Jest Configuration

A Global Config for Jest is created in the project's Taq folder: `.taq/jest.config.js`

Each partition will have it's own Jest configuration file (`tests/jest.config.js`)

The Jest configurations cascade down from the global config. If you want to override a value in the global config, simply define it in the partition config. The partition config will override the global config

## Plugin Architecture

This is a plugin developed for Taqueria built on NodeJS using the Taqueria Node SDK and distributed via NPM
