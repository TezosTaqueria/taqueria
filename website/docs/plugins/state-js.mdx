:::warning
This library is currently in alpha stage and is under active development
:::

`@taqueria/state-js` is an abstraction library which provides an easy way to interact with Taqueria State

To use the package in your front end code or tests, you can import it into any JS or TS file:

```js
import loadProject from "@taqueria/state-js"
```

Once imported, you can retrieve the list of originations like this:

```js
const {getOriginations} = await loadProject()
const results = getOriginations("increment.tz")
console.log(results)
```

To retrieve the most recently deployed version of a contract and the address:


```js
const [latest] = getOriginations("increment.tz")
```

To retrieve a list of all contracts deployed to the sandbox `local`:

```js
const results = getOriginations()
     .filter(contract => contract.destination === "local")
```

Additional documentation and live examples in scaffolds are coming soon
