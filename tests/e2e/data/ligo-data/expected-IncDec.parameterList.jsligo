#import "IncDec.jsligo" "Contract"

// Define your parameter values as a list of LIGO variable definitions
// When this file was created, the smart contract was defined with an entrypoint using `@entry` that was within a namespace. As such, the examples below are written with that assumption in mind.

// If your parameter is a simple value, you can define it directly
// E.g. const default_parameter = 10

// For added type-safety, you can reference the type of your parameter from the contract
// E.g. const default_parameter : parameter_of Contract.IncDec = 10
